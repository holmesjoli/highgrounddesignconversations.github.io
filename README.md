## Making Updates to Participants Page

Updates to the Participants's Bio's, Locations, and Attendance. (Speakers, Speakers Emeritus, Associates, and Scholars) can all be made on the [main data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qiS7xcxLwX8iwF9cs5CVKMKcJapze2UR382BO3-G82Q/edit?gid=0#gid=0).

Any updates made in the columns `City`, `State`, `Bio`, or attendance that matches the current year will automatically update on the website. The data is filtered by the current year, so to make any updates on who is attending or not, just update the attendance column.
